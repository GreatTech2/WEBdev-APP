         <h2>ORIGEN</h2>
         
        
         <p>Reddit was created in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian who were invited to apply to the start-up incubator Y Combinator. During a brainstorming session they got the idea for reddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. With the funding a support of Y Combinator Huffman and Ohanaian had it launched in 2005.</p>
         
             
         
             
             <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
         
         
             
             <p>For the most part the site is used as news sources and also internet culture it is divided into subreddits that are continuously growing. Through these subreddits people can receive the latest news on the topic that the particular subreddit is talking about. For example, the r/coronavirus has a constant influx of information regarding newly infected people in affected countries and ways to help stop the spread of the virus.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <h2>HOW IT CAN HELP YOU</h2>
         
         
             
             <p>There are many subreddits some can be very helpful to you course Through the subreddits people can gather up information on almost any topic within seconds. Due to the groups being public there are opinions and different works from people that come from all walks of life, giving others a wide variety of sources to collect information from.</p>
             
         
         
         
         <h2>HOW TO REGASTER</h2>
         
        
             
             <p>(1) By typing in reddit.com on the search bar you are automatically taken to the website. (2) On the top right hand corner you have 2 icons “Log in” or “Sign up”. If you are already a member, click LOG IN if not click SIGN UP. (3) Reddit makes signing up super easy, they ask for your email first. If your email is good to go, a green tick will appear by it. If there’s an x, you must have signed up already (4) You can choose a username here, if it has already been taken, there’s a few username suggestions reddit offers you. (5) Next up is the PASSWORD. Try to make a STRONG password  that you will remember. You never know what creeps are out there ☺ (6) Finally click the BOX to tick off that you’re not a robot. (7) There is a bar beside the password. If it’s on the red it means you have a weak password so try to stay on the green. (8) Finally you will be taken to a “find communities by topics you’re interested in”. (9) As you can see, I’ve already searched different things on reddit.There are so many different communities at the side bar which you can click onto. (10) I suggest you go onto the recommended tab. There are thousands of communities within reddit. You can literally find anything whether you want to watch cute animal videos or you’re into gaming it’s there. (11)confirm your email</p>
            
            
             <h2 >CAUTIONS</h2>
         
        
             
             <p>Trolling: There&#39;s two types of trolls- Nasty trolls who just wanna try and drag people down. Interesting trolls who get up to weird shenanigans to gain reactions. Boredom and to see how people do when they take out their element and are forced to actually try and argue the point, not just regurgitate something they were told.</p>
