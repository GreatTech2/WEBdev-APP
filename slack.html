         <h2>ORIGEN</h2>
         
        
         <p>Slack was developed by slack Technologies originally being an internal tool for Stewart Butterfield's company Tiny Speck during the making of an online game. In 2015 Slack had bean hacked after this incident they added two-factor authentication to their service. In 2019 Slack went public on April 26th. The name Slack is actually an anagram that stood for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.</p>
         
             
         
             
             <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
         
         
             
             <p>One of the mane features of Slack is its messaging many companies have a Slack group which allows its employees to remain in contact with each other outside of the workplace.  It was designed this way in order to help support the way people naturally work together, so that they can collaborate with other people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <h2>HOW IT CAN HELP YOU</h2>
         
         
             
             <p>As I said above Slack was designed to help people communicate with each other making it perfect for people doing group assignment allowing student to send each other files and asking for feed back you can also talk to a single individual using privet channels and since it is almost instant you don’t have to worry about a lag in communication. Teachers and Lectures even make there own Slack work place allowing them to stay in touch with their students providing you with the most up to date info.</p>
             
         
         
         <h2>HOW TO REGASTER</h2>
         
        
             
             <p>There are three main ways of joining a slack workspace,
                option 1 accept an email invitation from someone in the workspace,

                option 2 join your company&#39;s workspace automatically using your work email address

                option 3 find workspaces you&#39;re eligible to join by looking up your email address.

                Option one has two steps to first you have to Click Join Now on the invitation then just enter your full name and a password, then click Create Account.
                Option two joining automatically has a few more steps first go onto slack.com/get-started, then Click Find your workspace, then enter the approved email address, you will then get an email from slack, in the email click Confirm Email Address and finale next to your workspace&#39;s name, click Join to create an account and sign in.
                The third and final options finding any workspace you are eligible to join you just have to go on to slack.com/get-started and click Find your Slack workspaces.
                To create a slack workspace, go no to slack.com/create and enter your email address and you will get a 6-digit confirmation code, enter your code, then name your workspace, create a new channel for your workspace, add a few coworkers&#39; or friends email addresses. click See Your Channel in Slack to visit the workspace then Select Finish Signing Up at the top of the screen and enter your name and password, and finale click Finish to save.</p>
            
            
             <h2>CAUTIONS</h2>
         
        
             
             <p>Slack provides a service for all users called ‘Channels’, channels allows you to communicate to a person or a group through a hashtag set up by an admin when you join the hashtag you&#39;re a part of the group channel. 
             In regards to these ‘channels’ they can sometimes become more of a immature group chat than a professional outlet where groups of people can share their files, emails or notes.
             Linking in with the use of ‘channels’ bullying can happen as when joining groups with people who have the same interests but different outlooks can cause conflicts. There is not a lot of bullying documented on the app which is a positive.</p>
