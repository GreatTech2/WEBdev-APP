         <h2>ORIGEN</h2>
         
        
         <p>Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in the year 2006. The original name for the online social media service was twttr, however six months after its launch the name was changed to Twitter. </p>
         
             
         
             
             <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
         
         
             
             <p>Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your own page. On twitter you can use the hashtag key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word or phrase.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <h2>HOW IT CAN HELP YOU</h2>
         
         
             
             <p>Know a day’s teachers have students use Twitter in order to work on collaborative assignments. This way, you can also intervene at any point by giving a good advice, sharing an interesting link with your students, or helping them with important resources for research.</p>
             
         
         
         
          <h2>HOW TO REGASTER</h2>
         
        
             
             <p>to regaster go to Twitter.com and sign up. Use your name, your email, and a password. Use your real name and email. You will be able to customize your profile later. Then click “create my account”, next click “next”. Twitter will then asks you to follow 8 people from a selection it gives you.  You must follow 8 people from this selection, however you are able to skip this part. Finaly Twitter will then ask you confirm your email.  Check your email for the confirmation, and click on the link in the email from Twitter.</p>
            
            
             <h2>CAUTIONS</h2>
         
        
             
             <p>Micro-eLearning is great, but the limit of 140 characters on Twitter can be proven a real challenge. It might be difficult for you to express your thoughts effectively in so few words. The restriction of sending direct messages to only one user at a time could be proven inefficient when you want to use one of your learner’s comment to make a point</p>
